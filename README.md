# RTL_LDPC_SPA_Sequential
vivado project file for RTL (verilog) implementation of LDPC(Low Density Parity Check) codes SPA(sum product algorithm) with H(parity matrix) 1536*2650, code rate 1/2 from CCSDS standard. 
This is a Thesis project that was done to compare the performance of RTL vs HLS implementations
